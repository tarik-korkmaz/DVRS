# DVRS: Distance Vector Routing Simulator

DVRS is an implementation of a Bellman-Ford algorithm based distance vector routing protocol in Java.

I implemented DVRS as part of the "COMP 416: Computer Networks" class at Ko√ß University. Some code pieces were included in the project template and are not written by me.
